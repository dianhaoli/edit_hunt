# EditHunt lab notebook (append-only)

## 2026-09-29 — setup
- Hardware: Apple M4 (10-core GPU), 24 GB unified memory, MPS. No CUDA. Machine is under heavy memory
  pressure from other apps (~18 GB swap in use); raw MPS fp16 matmul benchmarks at ~0.8 TFLOPS, so
  everything is compute-bound. Qwen2.5-7B is not feasible here (brief: only with >=20 GB GPU).
- No `HF_TOKEN` in `.env` -> gated models (gemma-2-2b, Llama-3.2) are skipped.
- Env: project venv `.venv` (torch 2.14, transformers 5.17). The base conda env has a torchvision/torch
  mismatch that breaks transformers imports, so it is not used.
- dtype: fp32 on MPS (brief default for <=3B). fp16 check on 86 fs1 prompts: argmax over 50 capitals
  agrees 100%, median |score diff| 0.008 nats, max 0.07.
- Dataset (`edithunt/data.py`): 50 states, 343 curated cities after removing capitals, state-name
  substrings, and ~85 multi-state names. 32 non-reserved states have >=6 cities. Few-shot demo states
  (IL, FL, WA for fs1/ho_fs; NY, AZ, MI for fs2) are reserved and never source/target.
- Scoring: exact full-sequence log-prob of each of the 50 capital strings (19 are multi-token in the Qwen
  tokenizer, e.g. " Tall|ahas|see", " B|ism|ar|ck"). Continuations run off the KV cache. Pruning: a
  multi-token candidate's full log-prob <= its first-token log-prob, so continuations are computed only
  when that bound beats the current best -> the argmax is exact. Verified: pruned argmax == full-exact
  argmax on 86x2 prompts, and the bound is never violated.
- Shared-prefix KV cache for few-shot templates (pad inserted between prefix and suffix). Verified vs
  plain left-padding: max |score diff| 1.4e-4, identical argmax, captures match to 1e-4, with and
  without interventions.
- Observation (smoke test): Coeur d'Alene/fs1 greedy-decodes to " Lewiston" (not a capital) while the
  50-way argmax is Boise. "Valid" (50-way argmax) is therefore more lenient than greedy correctness;
  both are reported.
